## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep the community respectful and inclusive.

## How to Contribute

- **Bug Reports:** Use GitHub Issues to report bugs. Please include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- **Feature Requests:** Open a GitHub Issue or Discussion to propose a new feature.
- **Code Contributions:** Follow the process below to submit a pull request.

## Development Guidelines

- Ensure your code follows [PEP8](https://pep8.org/) using `flake8`.
- Use `black` for code formatting.
- All new code should include unit tests.
- Write docstrings following [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
- Avoid committing directly to `main`.

## Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready, stable code.
- `dev`: Development branch for new features and bug fixes.
- `feature/<name>`: Feature branches off `dev`.
- `bugfix/<name>`: Bug fix branches off `dev`.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

Examples:
- `feat: add new data processing module`
- `fix: resolve division by zero error`
- `docs: update README with installation steps`

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Create a new branch (`feature/my-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Push to your fork and create a PR targeting the `dev` branch.
5. Follow the PR template and ensure:
   - All checks pass.
   - The code is well-documented.
   - Youâ€™ve added or updated tests.

## Coding Standards

- Use `black` for consistent formatting: `black .`
- Lint with `flake8`: `flake8 .`
- Type checking with `mypy`: `mypy .`
- Environment variables should be managed via `.env` and `python-dotenv`.

## Testing

We use `pytest` for testing. To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure:
- Each new feature includes test coverage.
- Use test doubles and fixtures where needed.

## CI/CD via GitHub Actions

Our workflow includes:

- Code linting (flake8)
- Unit testing (pytest)
- Static type checks (mypy)
- Automatic formatting (black)
- Deployment scripts (if applicable)

All pull requests are validated through these checks. Please ensure they pass before requesting a review.
